The removeEventListener() method is used to remove an event listener that was previously added to an element using the addEventListener() method. This is useful when you want to stop listening for a particular event on an element.

Here is the basic syntax for the removeEventListener() method:

element.removeEventListener("event", listener);
Just like the addEventListener() method, the removeEventListener() method takes two arguments: the event you want to remove and the listener function that was previously added.

There is also an additional optional third argument that can be passed to the removeEventListener() method. This argument can either be the options or useCapture.

The options argument is an object that specifies the options for the event listener, such as whether the event listener should be passive or once.

The useCapture argument is a boolean value that specifies whether the event should be captured during the event propagation phase.

Most of the time, you will only need to pass the event and listener arguments to the removeEventListener() method.
